I did this prototype for an Airbnb clone to book teachers for kids (helloveronica.com). 

I started the work from a Rail template which was generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), which was mainly created during the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) by [Disha](https://github.com/disha-p), [Maximilien](https://github.com/MaxPhilipss) and [Luke](https://github.com/lbreen).
